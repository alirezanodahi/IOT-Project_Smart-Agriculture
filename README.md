Title: "Smart Agriculture IoT System"
Smart Agriculture IoT System
Overview
This project is an IoT-based smart agriculture system that monitors environmental parameters such as gas levels, soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. The system automates irrigation, heating, and cooling to optimize crop growth.

Project Architecture
Software:
Backend: Python (Django) for UI and backend.
Communication: Mosquitto for deploying the MQTT protocol.
Hardware:
Arduino Mega: Main microcontroller.
NodeMCU: Wireless communication module.
MQ-4: Methane gas sensor.
YL-69: Soil moisture sensor.
DHT-11: Temperature and humidity sensor.
LCD Keypad Shield: Local control and display.
Relays: Controls external devices (heaters, fans, etc.).
LEDs: Visual indicators for system status.
Other Components: Breadboards, power supply (12V, 7.5A adapter), fan, heater.
System Design
Below is the Fritzing diagram showing the circuit design for the system:


Setup Instructions
Software Setup:
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repo-url>
Create a virtual environment and activate it:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Django server:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
MQTT Setup:
Install Mosquitto:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt install mosquitto
Configure Mosquitto for your environment.
Set up MQTT clients to publish/subscribe to the necessary topics.
Hardware Setup:
Flash the Arduino Mega and NodeMCU with the provided C++ code.
Connect the sensors, relays, and actuators as per the circuit diagram.
Power the system using the 12V adapter and test each component.
Code Explanation
Arduino Code: Handles sensor readings and controls actuators based on the received MQTT messages.
Django Backend: Monitors sensor data and sends control signals via MQTT to the hardware.
MQTT Communication: The microcontrollers communicate with the Django backend via MQTT.
Usage
Web UI:
The Django admin panel allows you to monitor sensor data and control devices (e.g., irrigation system, fans).
LCD Keypad Shield:
Use the shield for manual control and real-time monitoring on the local display.
Future Enhancements
Integration with additional sensors (e.g., pH, EC sensors).
Improved user interface for better visualization of sensor data.
More advanced control algorithms for irrigation and climate control.
